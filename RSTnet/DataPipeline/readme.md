## Large-scale data processing pipeline
In this part, we introduce how to collect large-scale dataset for MLLM training. We mainly care about two types of audio data:

- [ ] Single-streaming speech data (TTS level speech data) <br>
- [ ] Two-streaming or Multi-streaming speech data (conversation speech data)

In this version, we only provide a data preprocessing pipeline for pre-collected multi-stream speech data (i.e. Fisher), and it is temporarily integrated in [MLLM/egs/moshi/ft/readme.md](../MLLM/egs/moshi_ft/readme.md)
