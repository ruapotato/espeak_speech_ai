# RSTnet: Real-time Speech-Text Foundation Model Toolkit (continuing update)
Building a real-time speech-text foundation model capable of understanding and generating speech has garnered significant attention. Notable examples of such models include ChatGPT-4o and Moshi. However, challenges in training these models continue to persist in the research community. We introduce RSTnet, a new open-source platform designed for developing real-time speech-text foundation models. RSTnet offers a comprehensive framework for data processing, pre-training, and fine-tuning, aimed at helping researchers build their real-time speech-text models efficiently. It builds upon previous works, such as the real-time spoken dialogue model (Moshi) and the universal audio generation model (UniAudio). RSTnet consists of following key components: (1) Data preparation; (2) streaming audio codec models; (3) speech-text foundation models; (4) Benchmark and Evaluation.

## News
- [x] 2025.3.4. We release the second version of RSTnet, which supports to pre-training speech-text foundation model. Please refer to MLLM_v2 to find the details.
- [x] 2024.10.7. We release the first version of RSTnet.

## Make Contributions
The project is still ongoing. If you have interest about RSTnet, welcome to make contribution. You can consider:
- [1] Propose issue or PR to solve the bugs
- [2] Propose more idea about Data collection, streaming codec, and speech-text foundation model
- [3] Join us as an author of this project. (Contact me by dcyang@se.cuhk.edu.hk)


## Install

```
conda create -n RSTnet python=3.12
conda activate RSTnet

## Technical report
You can find our technical report from https://github.com/yangdongchao/RSTnet/blob/main/RSTnet.pdf

## DataPipeline
More details will be updated soon. You can refer to DataPipeline part.

## AudioCodec
We plan to support more SOTA streaming audio codec. Now, we have reproduced the MimiCodec.

## Multi-modal LLM
We have released (1) the fine-tuning code for moshi (2) Pre-training speech-text foundation model recipes, which includes the following advantages:

(1) Supports any LLM backbone, includes LLAMA, Gemma, Mistral, Phi, StableLM, Qwen 

(2) Supports Lora fine-tuning LLM backbone to save the GPU resources

(3) Supports fully training for MLLM if you have ennough GPUs.
